For your employment test, you'll be adding a feature to a crate named LMDB ZERO.
https://github.com/AltSysrq/lmdb-zero

Your task will be to add a feature to be able to make queries to a database. LMDB zero doesn't not support queries, your goal is to add it.
We should be able to pass a STRING query, as this is an employment test, i'll just make it 3 features, INSERT, UPDATE and DEL


    QUERY_INSERT = "INSERT IN database_name KEY = XXXXXX | VALUE = xxxxxx";
    QUERY_UPDATE = "UPDATE database_name KEY = XXXXXX | NEW_VALUE = xxxxxx";
    QUERY_DELETE = "DELETE FROM database_name KEY = XXXXXX ";

    Those should be STRINGS.

We must be able to do it from anywhere in the program without passing the lmdb context, insert tests too.

--------

Goal is to create clone the crate and create a wrapper such that the new crate name would be "lmdb-zero-sql", 
implement the above three methods there in tx rs. Such that they can access the database without the lmdb context ... by db name and key value pair ...
i.e there should be sql layer over the lmdb zero such that the end user treat the code as sql not a b tree key val pairs. 

1. Run entire code in local with the above 3 functionalities. [Ongoing]
2. Create own crate and use in local 
3. migrate lmdb zero crate to my crate and update the above 3 functionalities there. 
4. Test in local .
5. Submit
